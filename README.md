This is a basic Travel Agent built with Google's Agent Development Kit - an open source framework for building AI Agents.

The Agent's purpose is help a client give recommendations on a destination and help book their trip to that destination, 
and it can acheive this through calling the SerpApi Google Flights and SerpAPI Google Hotels Apis, give a direct link to book their desired flight, 
and also search wikipedia with the Wikipedia API for information about a destination such as the history and culture.
